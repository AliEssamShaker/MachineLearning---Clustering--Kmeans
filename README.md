# MachineLearning---Clustering--Kmeans
Applying Kmeans clustering to a mall customers to determine who to target according to their income and their spendings.

This is a simple project where I applied the kmeans clustering machine learning tool to form clusters of the different type of customers.
I start off by importing the required libraries and finishing the data preprocessing phase. Please not that I decided to just include the annual income and spending score from the dataset. Then I used the elbow method to help me identify the number of clusters needed, and clearly as we see according the graph the answer is 5.

Following that I just simply trained the kmeans model on the dataset with a clusters parameter of 5, and then I just visualize the results.
